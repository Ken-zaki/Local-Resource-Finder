# 🌍 Local Resource Finder 🗺️  

## I. Overview 📋

This project is a **Local Resource Finder** 🎯 intended to help users locate valuable resources 🏗️ around their area 🏡 and find out where they're located 📍.

- **For Users** 👥: All users must **register first** 📝, and after that, they can find resources 🔍 based on the categories provided 📑. The program will display the **available resources** 📜 within the selected category.  
- **For Admins** 🛠️: Admins can update resources 🖊️ — for example, remove resources 🗑️ when unavailable or re-add them 🔄 when they become available again.

---

## II. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles 🧑‍💻  

### **Encapsulation** 🔒  
- Achieved by using **private** access modifiers in `Account.java` and `Resource.java`.  
- This restricts 🔐 direct access to the properties of these classes.  
- Data is accessed or modified using **public getter and setter methods** 🛡️, ensuring better control and security.  

**Account.java**
```java
   private String username;
   private String password;
```

**Resource.java**
```java
    private String category; 
    private String name;
    private String location;
    private String details;
```
### **Inheritance** 🧬  
- The `User` 👤 and `Admin` 🛠️ classes inherit from the **abstract class** `Account.java` using the `extends` keyword 📂.  
- Both subclasses **override** 🔄 the `displayMenu()` method to provide their specific implementations 🎨.  

**Account.java**
```java
    public abstract class Account
```
**Using extends** 
```java
    //user
    class User extends Account
    //admin
    class Admin extends Account
```
### **Abstraction** 🧩  
- The `Account.java` class is declared as **abstract** 📄.  
- It provides a common structure (`username`, `password`) 🗝️ and declares an **abstract method** `displayMenu()` 📜.  
- Subclasses (`User` 👥 and `Admin` 🛠️) provide their **unique implementation** of `displayMenu()` 🎯.  

**Account.java** 
```java
    public abstract class Account
```
**displayMenu()**
```java
    public abstract void displayMenu();
```
### **Polymorphism** 🌀  
- The `displayMenu()` method in `Account` is **overridden** in `User` and `Admin` classes for specific functionalities ⚙️.  
- The `instanceof` operator in `Main.java` is used to check whether an object belongs to `User` or `Admin` 🔎, allowing behavior to change dynamically 💡.  

**Account.java**
```java
         class User extends Account { 

            public User(String username, String password) {
                  super(username, password); 
            }
            @Override
            public void displayMenu() {
                  System.out.printf("User");
            }
         }

         class Admin extends Account {
            
            public Admin(String username, String password) {
               super(username, password);
            }
            @Override
            public void displayMenu() {
               System.out.printf("Admin");
            }
         } 
```
**Main.java**
```java
      if (accounts[i] instanceof User){ 
            userMenu((User) accounts[i]);
      } else if (accounts[i] instanceof Admin) {
            adminMenu((Admin) accounts[i]);
      }
```

## IV. Instructions for Running the Program 🖥️  

### General Instructions 🛠️  
- **Navigate the program** by selecting options with the corresponding number 🔢.  
- Follow the **on-screen prompts** 📖 for entering information.  

## How It Works 🌐

1. **Login/Register**:
   Users can log in with existing accounts or register a new account. Role assignments:
   - Passwords with "@" = Admin.
   - All other passwords = User.

2. **User Menu**:
   - View resources in specific categories.
   - Logout when done.

3. **Admin Menu**:
   - Add resources with details like name, location, and category.
   - Remove resources by name.
   - View resources in any category.
